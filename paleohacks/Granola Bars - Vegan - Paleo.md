## Granola Bars - Paleo Vegan

[NutritonRefined](https://nutritionrefined.com/granola-bars-with-date-caramel)

### Tools
 Food Processor
 7x7 baking pan
 Parchment paper



### Ingredients
* 1 1/4 cups Medjool dates, pitted
* 1 cup raw almonds, chopped
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
*  1/4 cup natural almond butter
* 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
* 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. fine sea salt





### Instructions
1. Line an 8" x 8" (20 cm x 20 cm) baking dish with parchment paper 
(this step is optional, but the parchment paper does help with removing the bars from the baking dish).

2. Place the dates into a food processor and pulse them until a "dough" like consistency forms.
3. Add all the ingredients into a bowl and mix to combine. The rolled oats should be completely coated and start to stick together in clumps.

4. Once thoroughly mixed, transfer the mixture to the parchment-lined baking dish. Use wet or lightly oiled hands to firmly press the mixture into the pan.



Raw version: let the bars firm up in fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes. 
Then remove the bars from the pan and cut them into 8-10 even bars. 

Baked version: preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C) with a rack in the middle of the oven. 
Bake the bars for 20-25 minutes for chewy granola bars or 25-30 minutes for crunchy bars. As soon as you remove the bars from the oven, press them down again with the back of a lightly oiled spatula. (This will give you more compacted granola bars.) Let the bars cool completely in the pan. Then remove the bars from the pan and cut them into 8-10 even bars. 


Store leftover bars covered in the refrigerator for 1 week. 
For longer term storage, freeze in an airtight container for 1-2 months.
